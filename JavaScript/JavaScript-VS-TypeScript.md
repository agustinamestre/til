# JavaScript VS TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?

It's a **JavaScript superset** , it means that TypeScript is a programming language building up on JavaScript. It takes the JavaScript language and adds new features and advantages to it and it makes writing JavaScript code easier and more powerful.

A disadvantage is that TypeScript can't be executed by JavaScript environments like the browser, so TypeScript compiles into standard JavaScript instead. This brings up one important question, *How can TypeScript add new features if what you get in the end is regular JavaScript?* The answer is the TypeScript compiler compiles the new features to *JavaScript workarounds*, so in the end it might give you a nicer syntax and easier way of doing someting and it will then compile that to a more complex JavaScript. 

## What does Typescript offer?

**Static type checking.** We can check and assign variable, parameter and function types. This gives us an oppotunity of indentifying errors in our code earlier before the script runs and the error occurs at runtime in the browser.
Static typing is completely optional.

**Modularity.** Typescript makes javascript more modular, so we can do things like import other files, modules and components. (Javascript supports modules with ES6 but in browsers it still recent)

**Class Based Objects.** We can work with classes in object-oriented programming. With JavaScript ES5 we had to use prototypes which is confusing. With ES6 we can use classes as well.

**ES6 features.** Typescript is fully compatible with all the ES6 features.

**Interfaces.** In TypeScript, interfaces are essential and allow you to create a multitude of advanced scenarios.


## Disadvantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript

TypeScript takes time to compile the code.
